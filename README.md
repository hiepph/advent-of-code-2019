# Advent of Code 2019  (*TBD*)

This year is entertaining since I get to build a [computer](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/2) that interprets integer codes.
Kudos to the people who involved to make it educational.

I use Java for this year with OOP style to encapsulate layers of abstractions and functionalities. It fits perfectly.

Code for the first days are terrible since I wanted to finish the challenges quickly, but I refined a lot along the way.
I had to refactor and add unit tests since the latter challenges require the previous computer module.


# Day 9

+ I keep getting this annoying `203` diagnostic code error:
  - Refer: [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/e8aw9j/2019_day_9_part_1_how_to_fix_203_error/).
  - Parameters that an instruction writes to will *never be in immediate mode*.
